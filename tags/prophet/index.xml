      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ahmedlahloum.github.io/accidents/traffic.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 600px;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last years, Machine learning has found its place in several fields of application of our daily life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I strongly believe that artificial intelligence can be used for good purposes, and even to save lives. I recently came across this very interesting &lt;a href = &#39;https://apolitical.co/solution_article/las-vegas-forging-big-data-partnership-predict-traffic-accidents/&#39;&gt; article &lt;/a&gt;, which talks about a Machine Learning project whose goal is to predict the number of accidents over the next two hours in Los Angeles to improve road traffic management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this idea very promising and with great potential for all the big cities of the world, so I decided to apply it to the city where I live currently, Paris. I started by gathering all the possible data made available by the government on this site. I cleaned the data and put it together in one dataset, then translated it and made it available on Kaggle so that anyone interested in this type of project could participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
