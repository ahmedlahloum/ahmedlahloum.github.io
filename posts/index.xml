      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ahmedlahloum.github.io/accidents/traffic.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width: 600px;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last years, Machine learning has found its place in several fields of application of our daily life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I strongly believe that artificial intelligence can be used for good purposes, and even to save lives. I recently came across this very interesting &lt;a href = &#39;https://apolitical.co/solution_article/las-vegas-forging-big-data-partnership-predict-traffic-accidents/&#39;&gt; article &lt;/a&gt;, which talks about a Machine Learning project whose goal is to predict the number of accidents over the next two hours in Los Angeles to improve road traffic management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this idea very promising and with great potential for all the big cities of the world, so I decided to apply it to the city where I live currently, Paris. I started by gathering all the possible data made available by the government on this site. I cleaned the data and put it together in one dataset, then translated it and made it available on Kaggle so that anyone interested in this type of project could participate.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sentiment Analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks and Bidirectional LSTMs.</title>

&lt;p&gt;With the rise of social media, Sentiment Analysis, which is one of the most well-known NLP tasks, gained a lot of importance over the years. The recent advances made in Machine Learning and Deep Learning made it an even more active task where a lot of work and research is still done.
The goal of this project is to explore and apply the most recent technics used in this task involving Deep learning and Neural Networks and to see and quantify the benefit of using those technics to this kind of problem. This is also an opportunity for me to develop my skills in this field and test several ideas I always wanted to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Association Rule Learning by Bump Hunting.</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bump Hunting is the process of finding regions space (defined by the features) with high or low values for the target variable. The goal of Bump Hunting is not to classify the observations but to find regions where the density of a certain class of the target is Highly or poorly represented:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ahmedlahloum.github.io/bumps/bump.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between the features and the target variable that we can formalize simply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome everyone,
My name is Ahmed Lahlou Mimi, I&amp;rsquo;m from Morocco. I’m currently a Student in Data Science (in France). I’m finishing a Gap year where I had the occasion to be a data scientist in 3 different companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created this website to present some of my projects that I find worth sharing.
I view this website as an opportunity to learn first and foremost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
